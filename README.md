# Customer loss Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project aims to predict whether a customer will leave the bank using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The dataset used is the "Churn_Modelling.csv", and the model is built using TensorFlow, with data preprocessing handled by Pandas and Scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

- **Technologies Used**: TensorFlow, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Goal**: To predict customer attrition and help the bank implement retention strategies.
